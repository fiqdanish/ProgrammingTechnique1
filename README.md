<h1>Programming Technique 1</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
As a fundamental subject, this course equips the students with theory and practice on
problem solving techniques by using the structured approach. Students are required to
develop programs using C++ programming language, in order to solve simple to moderate
problems. The course covers the following: pre-processor directives, constants and
variables, data types, input and output statements, control structures: sequential, selection
and loop, built-in and user-defined functions, single and two-dimensional arrays, file
operations, pointers, and structured data types.
